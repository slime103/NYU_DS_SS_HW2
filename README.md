# NYU_DS_SS_HW2
This program was created for Homework Two in Professor Bari's Data Structures class at NYU. It was created as a means of understanding sorting algorithms through implementation.

It primarily serves as a personal refrence point and thus has no executable jar file. 

A big thanks to my TA Alan for helping me think through the algorithms and complete the assignment on time. In his own words, "Be smart."
